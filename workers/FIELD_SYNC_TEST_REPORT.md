# FX CRM Sync Web Interface Field Testing Report

**Test Date:** August 9, 2025  
**Test URL:** https://fx-crm-sync.lai-jameslai.workers.dev/  
**Test Focus:** Opportunity object field mappings after database updates  

## Executive Summary

The web interface testing reveals that **the database field definition updates have NOT yet taken effect**. The system is still using predefined field mappings that contain the problematic "浴櫃價格" (bathroom cabinet price) field.

## Test Results

### ✅ Successfully Completed Tests

1. **Web Interface Accessibility**
   - URL is accessible and loads properly
   - Admin interface displays correctly
   - All JavaScript components function

2. **Opportunity Object Detection**
   - Found 7 references to "Opportunity/商機" in the interface
   - NewOpportunityObj is properly listed with 61 fields
   - Object display name shows as "商機" correctly

3. **Field Data Analysis**
   - Successfully retrieved field data via API
   - Field count: 81 fields total
   - Data structure is properly formatted

### ❌ Issues Identified

1. **Data Source Status**
   - **Current:** `predefined` (CSV predefined data)
   - **Expected:** `database` (from fx_field_definitions table)

2. **Bathroom Cabinet Field Still Present**
   - Field API Name: `field_l47x8__c`
   - Field Label: `浴櫃價格`
   - Field Type: `CURRENCY`
   - **Status:** Still exists in the API response

3. **Field Sync Not Functional**
   - Field sync endpoints return "Not Found" errors
   - Database field definitions table appears empty
   - No mechanism to trigger real-time field updates

## Technical Analysis

### API Behavior
The `/api/schema/NewOpportunityObj/fields` endpoint follows this logic:
1. **First:** Try to get fields from `fx_field_definitions` table
2. **Fallback:** Use predefined field mappings if database is empty
3. **Last resort:** Query CRM API directly

Currently, the system is hitting the fallback condition (step 2).

### Database Status
- **Connection:** ✅ Connected
- **Tables:** ✅ 8 tables exist with data
- **Field Definitions:** ❌ `fx_field_definitions` table appears empty
- **Object Definitions:** ❌ May not have required entries

### Web Interface Behavior
The web interface correctly shows:
- Data source indicator: "來源: API 動態獲取" (but actually using predefined)
- Field statistics are calculated properly
- Search and filter functionality works

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be that:

1. **Database Updates Not Applied:** The SQL scripts to remove the bathroom cabinet field from `fx_field_definitions` may not have been executed
2. **Missing Field Sync:** The field synchronization process hasn't been triggered
3. **Table Dependencies:** Required entries in `fx_object_definitions` may be missing

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Verify Database Updates**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fx_field_definitions WHERE object_api_name = 'NewOpportunityObj';
   SELECT * FROM fx_field_definitions WHERE field_api_name = 'field_l47x8__c';
   ```

2. **Check Object Definitions Table**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM fx_object_definitions WHERE api_name = 'NewOpportunityObj';
   ```

3. **Manual Field Sync Trigger**
   - Ensure `fx_object_definitions` has proper entries
   - Execute field sync process manually
   - Verify `fx_field_definitions` gets populated with real CRM data

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Implement Health Checks**
   - Add endpoint to verify database table status
   - Create monitoring for field sync processes
   - Add data source validation

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Better error messages for field sync failures
   - Fallback indicators when using predefined data
   - Admin alerts for missing database entries

3. **Deployment Verification**
   - Post-deployment checks for critical tables
   - Automated field sync after database updates
   - Validation that removes test/fake fields

## Test Files Generated

1. `field-sync-results.json` - Detailed field sync attempt results
2. `analysis-results.json` - Web interface analysis data
3. `opportunity-fields-test.json` - API endpoint test results
4. `database-test-results.json` - Database connectivity tests
5. `page-content.html` - Complete web interface HTML snapshot
6. `page-content.txt` - Extracted text content

## Conclusion

While the SQL update to remove the "浴櫃價格" field was correctly prepared, **the field sync process needs to be completed** to make the database changes take effect in the web interface. The system currently shows predefined data with the unwanted field still present.

**Priority:** HIGH - Field sync process needs immediate attention to reflect real CRM data without fake fields.
